            Founded in 2020, The Green Cause is an environmental nonprofit organization based around promoting environmental activism among the youth and larger communities through the making of various content, such as lessons and social media posts. To strengthen our impact, we have recently launched our brand new chapter structure, which allows people to spread environmental awareness in their own communities as part of The Green Cause. This gives many individuals a chance to connect with their cities more closely and form a strong team to combat climate change. Individuals who are involved in a chapter have the autonomy to do what they think is best to fit the interests of their community in hopes to educate and inspire more people to join the cause. We, as the board of The Green Cause, truly believe that the involvement of every person is so crucial to create change in this world, which is what we hope to accomplish with this launch. We hope that you too can be a leader, and work with us to change the world for the better.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Starting a chapter for The Green Cause serves as an opportunity to work with your community to address climate change. This allows you to connect with city and/or school officials, create events & projects, and bring together a coalition of like-minded students. You will be able to learn & apply many important leadership development skills that will help you with your future endeavors. You will be able to have autonomy to make decisions for your own chapter and create a vision for The Green Cause with all the resources and support provided by us. All of this while learning more about the environmental field and earning community service hours for your hard work!
