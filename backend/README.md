# ðŸŒ² The Green Cause Backend

## ðŸš€ How to start backend development:

Welcome to the backend development guide for The Green Cause! Follow these steps to set up your development environment and begin working on the Flask server:

### 1. Install Python
First, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create a virtual environment
Navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows (in CMD):
```bash
venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```
- Windows (in Powershell):
```bash
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
- MacOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install packages
Install the required packages from __requirements.txt__:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the server
Start the Flask server by running __flask run__:
- Windows
```bash
python -m flask run

or

flask run
```
- MacOS/Linux
```bash
python -m flask run

or

flask run
```

ðŸš€ The server should now be running locally on localhost:5000.
